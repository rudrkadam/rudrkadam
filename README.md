## Hello, I'm Rudra ðŸ‘‹

A final-year Engineering undergrad pursuing a **Bachelor of Engineering** (B.E.) in **Information Technology** at Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT), Pune.

I'm a **backend developer** with a solid grip on the **Java language** and working knowledge of **Spring Boot**. I'm confident in my ability to troubleshoot and solve complex problems independently, often relying on the internet and my curiosity as key tools.

I recently built a **Chromium browser extension** as my [final-year capstone project](https://github.com/rudrkadam/Dark-Patterns-Detector/), which detects and highlights dark patterns on e-commerce sites using **LLMs**. This project pushed me to explore new technologies beyond my comfort zone. As part of my academic work, I also developed the end-to-end backend of a job listing web application using Spring Boot and MongoDB, allowing users to post and apply for jobs.

I'm always curious to learn new tools and technologies and am driven by the idea of building **meaningful**, **impactful**, and **scalable** real-world solutions with what I learn.
