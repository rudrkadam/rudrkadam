## Hello, I'm Rudra ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent engineering graduate from **Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT), Pune**, and currently working as an **Associate Software Engineer** at **LogicMonitor**, a leading IT infrastructure monitoring and observability company.

I'm passionate about open-source software and love exploring how things work under the hood. Outside of work, you'll usually find me enjoying video games, cinema, visual storytelling, and traveling.

Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to chat about tech, open-source, cinema or just interesting ideas.
